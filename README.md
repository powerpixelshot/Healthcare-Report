# Healthcare-Report

The Healthcare report was created with the aim of developing a comprehensive data visualization solution through Power BI. The main goal of this initiative was to provide an interactive tool for the Hospital Management Team to monitor and analyze patient visits, equipment availability, and revenue generated by patients across different age groups. Additionally, the management team can track patient waiting times for doctor appointments, as well as gather feedback on doctor prescriptions and other hospital services.

I utilized MS Excel as the data source and performed various data transformations such as merging, removing, trimming, and changing column data types in the Power Query editor to ensure data consistency and accuracy. Subsequently, I loaded the dimension and fact tables into Power BI.

Furthermore, I created a data model to establish relationships between the fact and dimension tables, including bed details, staff details, department details, and dataset tables.

Through data analysis, I identified requirements and developed key performance indicators (KPIs) using card visuals. I also designed a range of interactive visuals such as bar charts, line charts, maps, and tables, incorporating custom visuals like rotating cards and scrollers.

Moreover, I implemented drill-down and drill-through capabilities to enable the management team to access detailed patient views. The dashboard features filters and slicers to assist end users in data analysis. 

Overall, this project provides the management team with centralized information to monitor ongoing hospital activities and make data-driven decisions.
